# NOTE: These CIDR blocks are commonly associated with major web crawlers
# and large platform providers. IP ownership and ranges change over time.
# Verify each block (for example via whois/ASN lookups or provider docs) before
# relying on them in production. Consider using ASN-based lookups (e.g., AS15169
# for Google, AS8075 for Microsoft) for broader coverage.
